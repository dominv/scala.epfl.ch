## We're hiring!

We're looking for motivated individuals to help us improve Scala's libraries and
tools.

Candidates must have a minimum of 3 years of experience developing in Scala, and
have a demonstrated track record of communicating (written or talks) with the
developer community. Several years experience participating in an open source
community required.

If getting paid to build up important community open source projects, and
promoting, advancing, and supporting Scala, sounds like you, then drop us a line
at <a href="scala.center@epfl.ch">scala.center@epfl.ch</a> with your resume and GitHub profile.
